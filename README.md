# WM-LTM-EpisodicContamination
Data and scripts accompanying our study of working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM). We examine episodic-contamination, showing that repetition improves LTM fidelity and reduces swap errors, challenging WM process purity.

## Overview
This project investigates the interaction between working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM), testing the **episodic-contamination hypothesis**.  
Across two experiments, participants memorized the colors of real-world objects. We systematically manipulated repetition to examine memory fidelity and swap errors.  

- **Experiment 1a:** Compared WM fidelity (short delays) with LTM fidelity (3-min delay, with 1/8/18 repetitions).  
- **Experiment 1b:** Extended to swap errors when recalling multiple objects, contrasting WM and LTM.  
- **Key findings:**  
  - LTM fidelity improved with repetition and surpassed WM after 18 exposures.  
  - Swap errors decreased with repetition for LTM but remained stable for WM.  
  - These results support the episodic-contamination hypothesis, challenging the assumption of process purity in WM tasks.
